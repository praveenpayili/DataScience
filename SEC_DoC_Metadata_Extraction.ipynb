Consolidated Financial Statements:\\nBasis of Presentation\\nThese interim statements and related management\\'s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the\\nConsolidated Financial Statements and the related notes  and management\\'s discussion and analysis of results  of\\noperations,  liquidity and capital resources included in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K ( 2015 Form 10-K\").\\nThese interim statements are unaudited.  The year-end balance sheet data included in this Form 10-Q was  derived\\nfrom  audited  financial  statements,  but does  not  include  all disclosures  required  by  generally accepted\\naccounting principles in the United States of America.  We have historically operated and continue to operate on\\na 52/53 week fiscal year ending on the Friday closest to the last day of the quarter.  For ease of presentation,\\nSeptember 30  and December  31 are  used consistently  throughout this  Form 10-Q  and these  interim  financial\\nstatements  and related notes  to represent the  period-end dates.  For  the 2016 and  2015 quarters, the actual\\nclosing dates  were September  30, and  October 2,  respectively.  The  unaudited interim  financial  statements\\ninclude all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) and accruals necessary in the judgment\\nof management for a fair statement of the results for the periods presented.  When used herein, the terms  IFF,\"\\nthe Company,\" we,\" us\" and our\" mean International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.  and its consolidated subsidiaries.\\nReclassifications and Revisions\\nCertain prior year amounts have been reclassified and revised to conform with current year presentation.\\nThe  Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015,  has been revised to properly reflect in-bound goods in\\ntransit.  Accordingly, Inventory  and Accounts  payable decreased  by $17.0  million.  This  adjustment was  not\\nmaterial to the previously issued financial statements.\\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\\nIn  August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards  Board ( FASB\") issued authoritative guidance which requires\\nchanges to the classification of certain activities within  the statement of cash flows.  This guidance will  be\\neffective  for annual and interim  periods beginning after December 15,  2017.  Early adoption will be permitted\\nfor all entities.  The Company does not expect this adoption will have a significant impact on its statement  of\\ncash flows.\\nIn  March  2016,  the FASB  issued  authoritative guidance  which  requires changes  to  several aspects  of the\\naccounting   for  share-based  payment  transactions,  including  the  treatment  of  income  tax  consequences,\\nclassification  of awards as either equity or liabilities,  and classification of certain items on the statement\\nof cash flows.  This  guidance will be  effective for annual  and interim periods  beginning after December  15,\\n2016.   Early adoption  will be  permitted for all  entities.  Among  other changes, the  standard requires that\\nemployee taxes paid when an employer withholds shares  be presented in the Consolidated Statement of Cash  Flows\\nas  a  financing  activity  instead  of  an  operating activity.   The  Company  expects  to  adopt  this change\\nretroactively and that the impact  of this aspect of  the standard on the  Consolidated Statement of Cash  Flows\\nwill be approximately $20-$25 million on an annual basis.  The Company is currently evaluating the other changes\\nrequired by the standard.\\nIn  February 2016, the FASB  issued authoritative guidance which requires  changes to the accounting for leases.\\nThe new  guidance  establishes a  new  lease accounting  model,  that requires  entities  to record  assets  and\\nliabilities  related to leases on the balance sheet for certain types of leases.  The guidance will be effective\\nfor annual and interim  periods beginning after  December 31, 2018.   Early adoption will  be permitted for  all\\nentities.   The Company expects the adoption of this guidance will result in significant increases to assets and\\nliabilities on its Consolidated Balance Sheet and is  still evaluating the impact on its Consolidated  Statement\\nof Comprehensive Income.\\nIn  September  2015,  the  FASB issued  authoritative  guidance  relating  to the  adjustments  made  during the\\nmeasurement period for items  in a business  combination.  Specifically, the  new guidance requires  adjustments\\nrelated  to the finalization of estimates  to be recorded in the period  when they are determined and to provide\\ncertain additional disclosures.  This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,  2015.\\nThe  Company  adopted this  guidance during  2016 and  the adoption  did not  have a  significant impact  on its\\nconsolidated financial statements.\\nIn  April 2015,  the FASB issued  authoritative guidance  which requires that  debt issuance costs  related to a\\nrecognized debt liability be presented in  the balance sheet as a direct  deduction from the carrying amount  of\\nthat  debt liability.  This  guidance is effective for  annual and interim periods  beginning after December 15,\\n2015.  The Company  adopted this  guidance retrospectively  in 2016 and  accordingly has  reclassified all  debt\\nissuance costs on long-term debt as a direct deduction from the\\n\\n 5\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\ncarrying  amount of the debt liability in the Consolidated  Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015.  The adoption\\nof this guidance did not have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.\\nIn  May 2014, the FASB issued  authoritative guidance to clarify the principles  to be used to recognize revenue\\nand made subsequent clarifications under  the new requirements during May  2016.  The guidance is applicable  to\\nall  entities and is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  Adoption as of\\nthe original effective date is permitted.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact that this new standard\\nwill have on its consolidated financial statements.\\nAccounts Receivable\\nThe  Company sells certain accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis to unrelated financial institutions under\\nfactoring\" agreements that are sponsored, solely and  individually, by certain customers.  The Company  accounts\\nfor  these transactions as sales of receivables, removes the receivables sold from its financial statements, and\\nrecords cash proceeds when received by the Company.   The beneficial impact on cash provided by operations  from\\nparticipating  in these programs increased  approximately $25.8 million for the  nine months ended September 30,\\n2016 compared to an increase of  approximately $0.2 million for the nine  months ended September 30, 2015.   The\\ncost of participating in these programs was immaterial to our results in all periods.\\n\\nNote 2.  Net Income Per Share:\\nNet  income per share is  based on the weighted  average number of shares  outstanding.  A reconciliation of the\\nshares used in the computation of basic and diluted net income per share is as follows:\\n\\n                                    Three Months Ended September 30,      Nine Months Ended September 30,\\n(SHARES IN THOUSANDS)               2016                 2015             2016                  2015\\nBasic                               79,580               80,330           79,727                80,602\\nAssumed dilution under stock plans  355                  407              340                   450\\nDiluted                             79,935               80,737           80,067                81,052\\nAn  immaterial  amount of  stock-settled appreciation  rights (  SSARs\") were  excluded from  the computation of\\ndiluted net income  per share for  the three  and nine months  ended September  30, 2016.  There  were no  stock\\noptions or SSARs excluded from the 2015 periods.\\nThe  Company has issued shares  of purchased restricted common stock  and purchase restricted common stock units\\n(collectively PRSUs\") which contain rights  to nonforfeitable dividends while  these shares are outstanding  and\\nthus are considered participating securities.  Such securities are required to be included in the computation of\\nbasic and  diluted earnings  per share  pursuant to  the  two-class method.   The Company  did not  present  the\\ntwo-class  method since  the difference  between basic and  diluted net  income per share  for both unrestricted\\ncommon shareholders and  PRSU shareholders was  less than  $0.01 per share  for each period  presented, and  the\\nnumber  of PRSUs outstanding  as of September  30, 2016 and 2015  was immaterial.  Net  income allocated to such\\nPRSUs was $0.2 million and $0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively and\\n$0.8 million and $1.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\\nNote 3.  Acquisitions:\\n2016 Activity\\nDavid Michael\\nOn  October 7, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition  of 100% of the outstanding shares of David Michael &\\nCompany, Inc.  (\"David Michael\") for  approximately $242 million.  The purchase  price was funded from  existing\\nresources.   David Michael was acquired to strengthen the North American flavors business.  The acquisition will\\nbe accounted for as a  business combination and is  not expected to have a  material impact on the  consolidated\\nstatement of comprehensive income for 2016.\\n2015 Activity\\nLucas Meyer\\nDuring  the third quarter of  2015, the Company completed  the acquisition of 100%  of the outstanding shares of\\nLucas Meyer  Cosmetics, a  business of  Unipex  Group.  The  total shares  acquired include  shares  effectively\\nacquired  pursuant to  put and  call option agreements.   The acquisition  was accounted for  under the purchase\\nmethod.  Total consideration was approximately Euro 284.0 million ($312.1 million), including approximately $4.8\\nmillion of cash acquired.  The Company paid\\n\\n 6\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nEuro 282.1 million (approximately $309.9 million) for the acquisition, which was funded from existing resources,\\nand recorded  a liability  of approximately  Euro 2.0  million (approximately  $2.2 million)  for shares  to  be\\npurchased  under the put and call option agreements.  The purchase price exceeded the fair value of existing net\\nassets by approximately $290.1 million.  The excess was allocated principally to identifiable intangible  assets\\n(approximately  $156.4  million), goodwill  (approximately $179.5  million) and  approximately $38.1  million to\\ndeferred taxes.   Goodwill represents  the excess  of the  purchase  price over  the fair  value of  net  assets\\nacquired.   Separately  identifiable  intangible  assets  are  principally  related  to  customer relationships,\\nproprietary technology and  patents.  The intangible  assets are  being amortized over  the following  estimated\\nuseful  lives: trade names and  proprietary technology, 28 years; customer  relationships, 23 years; patents, 11\\nyears; and non-solicitation agreements, 3 years.\\nNo  pro forma financial information for 2015 is presented as the impact of the acquisition was immaterial to the\\nConsolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.  The purchase  price allocation was completed during the  second\\nquarter of 2016.\\nOttens Flavors\\nDuring  the second quarter of 2015,  the Company completed the acquisition of  100% of the outstanding shares of\\nHenry H.  Ottens  Manufacturing Co.,  Inc.  (\"Ottens  Flavors\").  The acquisition  was accounted  for under  the\\npurchase  method.   The  Company  paid $198.9  million  (including  $10.4  million of  cash  acquired)  for this\\nacquisition, which was funded from existing resources.   The purchase price allocation was completed during  the\\nfourth  quarter  of 2015.   No pro  forma  financial information  for 2015  is  presented as  the impact  of the\\nacquisition was not material to the consolidated financial statements.\\nNote 4.  Restructuring and Other Charges, Net:\\nDuring  the fourth quarter of 2015,  the Company established a series  of initiatives intended to streamline its\\nmanagement structure, simplify decision-making  and accountability, better leverage  and align its  capabilities\\nacross the organization and improve efficiency of its global manufacturing and operations network.  As a result,\\nin the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $7.6 million, included in  restructuring\\nand  other charges, net, related  to severance and related costs  pertaining to approximately 150 positions that\\nwill be affected.  During 2016, the Company made payments of $1.8 million and recorded accelerated  depreciation\\nexpense  of $0.5 million.   The total cost of  the plan is  expected to be approximately  $10.5 million with the\\nremaining charges relating principally to  accelerated depreciation.  The Company expects  the plan to be  fully\\nimplemented in the second half of 2017.\\nChanges  in employee-related restructuring liabilities during the  nine months ended September 30, 2016, were as\\nfollows:\\n\\n(DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)               Employee-Related Costs    Accelerated Depreciation    Total\\nBalance at December 31, 2015         $        7,882            $                           $    7,882\\nAdditional charges (reversals), net                            473                         473\\nNon-cash charges                                               (473              )         (473        )\\nPayments and other costs             (1,801           )                                    (1,801      )\\nBalance at September 30, 2016        $        6,081            $                           $    6,081\\nNote 5.

The Company received proceeds  related to the issuance  of\\nthese Euro Senior Notes - 2016 of Euro 496.0 million which was net of the Euro 0.9 million discount and Euro 3.1\\nmillion underwriting discount (recorded as  deferred financing costs).  In  addition, the Company incurred  $1.3\\nmillion  of other deferred  financing costs in connection  with the debt issuance.   In connection with the debt\\nissuance, the Company entered into pre-issuance hedging transactions that were settled upon issuance of the debt\\nand  resulted in a loss of approximately $3.2  million.  The discount, deferred financing costs and pre-issuance\\nhedge loss are being amortized as interest expense over the eight year term of the debt.  The Euro Senior  Notes\\n- 2016 bear interest at a rate of 1.75% per annum, with interest payable on March 14 of each year, commencing on\\nMarch 14, 2017.

However,  no make-whole premium will  be paid for redemptions of  the Euro Senior Notes  -\\n2016 on or after December 14, 2023.  The indenture provides for customary events of default and contains certain\\nnegative covenants that limit the ability  of the Company and its subsidiaries  to grant liens on assets, or  to\\nenter  into  sale-leaseback transactions.   In addition,  subject to  certain limitations,  in the  event of the\\noccurrence of both (1) a change of  control of the Company and (2) a  downgrade of the Euro Senior Notes -  2016\\nbelow  investment grade rating by both Moody\\'s Investors  Services, Inc.  and Standard & Poor\\'s Ratings Services\\nwithin a specified time period, the Company will be required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes at a price\\nequal  to 101% of the principal amount of the Euro  Senior Notes - 2016, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the\\ndate of repurchase.\\nAs  discussed in Note  11, the Euro  Senior Notes -  2016 have been designated  as a hedge  of the Company\\'s net\\ninvestment in certain subsidiaries.\\nDuring the third quarter of 2016, the Company made a final payment of $125.0 million on the Senior Notes - 2006.\\nCommercial Paper\\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company issued $50 million face value of commercial paper.\\nNote 7.  Income Taxes:\\nUncertain Tax Positions\\nAt  September 30, 2016, the Company had $19.6 million of unrecognized tax benefits recorded in Other liabilities\\nand $4.9  million in  Other  current liabilities.   If  these unrecognized  tax  benefits were  recognized,  the\\neffective tax rate would be affected.\\nAt  September 30,  2016, the  Company had  accrued interest and  penalties of  $0.7 million  classified in Other\\nliabilities and $0.2 million in Other current liabilities.\\nAs of September 30, 2016, the Company\\'s aggregate provisions for uncertain tax positions, including interest and\\npenalties, was $25.4 million associated  with various tax positions asserted  in foreign jurisdictions, none  of\\nwhich is individually material.\\nThe  Company regularly repatriates  a portion of current  year earnings from select  non U.S.  subsidiaries.  No\\nprovision is made for additional taxes on undistributed  earnings of subsidiary companies that are intended  and\\nplanned  to be  indefinitely invested in  such subsidiaries.   We intend to,  and have plans  to, reinvest these\\nearnings indefinitely in our foreign subsidiaries to fund local operations and/or capital projects.\\nThe Company has ongoing income tax audits and legal proceedings which are at various stages of administrative or\\njudicial review.  In  addition, the  Company has open  tax years  with various taxing  jurisdictions that  range\\nprimarily  from 2006 to 2015.  Based on currently  available information, we do not believe the ultimate outcome\\nof any of  these tax audits  and other tax  positions related  to open tax  years, when finalized,  will have  a\\nmaterial impact on our financial position.\\nThe  Company also  has other ongoing  tax audits and  legal proceedings that  relate to indirect  taxes, such as\\nvalue-added taxes, sales and use taxes and property taxes, which are discussed in Note 13.\\nEffective Tax Rate\\nThe effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was 20.8% compared with 25.5% for the three\\nmonths ended September  30, 2015.   The quarter-over-quarter  decrease was  largely due  to a  favorable mix  of\\nearnings  and lower costs of  repatriation, partially offset by higher  loss provisions.  The effective tax rate\\nfor the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was  22.7% compared with 22.1% for the nine months ended  September\\n30,  2015.  The year-over-year increase  was primarily due to  a benefit of $10.5  million recorded in the first\\nquarter of 2015, as a result of favorable tax rulings in Spain and another jurisdiction for which reserves  were\\npreviously  recorded and higher loss provisions  in 2016, partially offset by  lower cost of repatriation in the\\n2016 period.\\n\\n 9\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNote 8.

Financial Instruments:\\nFair Value\\nAccounting  guidance on fair value  measurements specifies a hierarchy of  valuation techniques based on whether\\nthe inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable.  Observable inputs reflect market  data\\nobtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions.  These two types of\\ninputs create the following fair value hierarchy:\\n\\n Level 1 Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.\\n \\n Level 2 Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and\\n model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets.\\n \\n Level 3 Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.\\nThis  hierarchy  requires  us  to use  observable  market  data, when  available,  and  to minimize  the  use of\\nunobservable inputs when determining fair value.  We  determine the fair value of structured liabilities  (where\\nperformance  is linked to structured interest rates, inflation or currency risks) using the LIBOR swap curve and\\nforward interest and exchange  rates at period  end.  Such instruments are  classified as Level  2 based on  the\\nobservability of significant inputs to the model.  We do not have any instruments classified as Level 1 or Level\\n3, other than those included in pension asset trusts as discussed in Note 13 of our 2015 Form 10-K.\\nThese  valuations take into  consideration our credit  risk and our counterparties\\'  credit risk.  The estimated\\nchange in the fair value of these instruments due to such changes in our own credit risk (or instrument-specific\\ncredit risk) was immaterial as of September 30, 2016.\\n\\nThe  amounts  recorded  in the  balance  sheet (carrying  amount)  and the  estimated  fair values  of financial\\ninstruments at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 consisted of the following:\\n\\n                                       September 30, 2016                     December 31, 2015\\n(DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)                 Carrying             Fair              Carrying             Fair\\n                                       Amount               Value             Amount               Value\\nCash and cash equivalents              $    498,730         $    498,730      $    181,988         $    181,988\\nCredit facilities and bank overdrafts  13,112               13,112            142,178              142,178\\nLong-term debt:\\nSenior notes - 2006                                                           124,964              127,717\\nSenior notes - 2007                    499,638              577,132           499,618              563,855\\nSenior notes - 2013                    297,916              316,742           297,683              290,830\\nEuro Senior notes - 2016               555,381              604,035\\n \\n(1)  The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value due to the short maturity of those instruments.\\n \\n(2)  The carrying amount of our credit facilities and bank overdrafts approximates fair value as the interest rate is reset frequently based on current\\n     market rates as well as the short maturity of those instruments.\\n \\n(3)  The fair value of our long-term debt was calculated using discounted cash flows applying current interest rates and current credit spreads based on\\n     our own credit risk.\\nDerivatives\\nThe  Company periodically enters into foreign currency forward contracts with the objective of reducing exposure\\nto cash flow volatility associated with our  intercompany loans, foreign currency receivables and payables,  and\\nanticipated  purchases  of certain  raw materials  used in  operations.

These swaps are designated as fair value hedges.  Amounts recognized in Interest expense were\\nimmaterial for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.\\nDuring the first quarter of 2016, the Company entered into and terminated two Euro interest rate swap agreements\\nto hedge the anticipated  issuance of fixed-rate debt.

Commitments and Contingencies:\\nGuarantees and Letters of Credit\\nThe Company has various bank guarantees and letters of credit which are available for use to support its ongoing\\nbusiness operations  and to  satisfy governmental  requirements associated  with pending  litigation in  various\\njurisdictions.\\nAt September 30, 2016, we had total bank guarantees and standby letters of credit of approximately $39.2 million\\nwith various financial institutions.  Included in the above aggregate amount is a total of $16.2 million in bank\\nguarantees  which the  Company has posted  for certain  assessments in Brazil  for other diverse  income tax and\\nindirect tax disputes  related to fiscal  years 1998-2011.  There  were no material  amounts utilized under  the\\nstandby letters of credit as of September 30, 2016.\\nIn  order to  challenge the assessments  in these  cases in Brazil,  the Company  has been required  to, and has\\nseparately pledged assets,  principally property, plant  and equipment, to  cover assessments in  the amount  of\\napproximately $13.5 million as of September 30, 2016.\\nLines of Credit\\nThe  Company has various  lines of credit  which are available  to support its  ongoing business operations.  At\\nSeptember 30, 2016, we  had available lines of  credit (in addition  to the $950 million  of capacity under  the\\nCredit Facility discussed in Note 8 of our 2015 Form 10-K) of approximately $76.9 million with various financial\\ninstitutions.  There were no significant amounts  drawn down pursuant to these  lines of credit as of  September\\n30, 2016.\\nLitigation\\nThe  Company  assesses contingencies  related to  litigation  and/or other  matters to  determine the  degree of\\nprobability and range of possible loss.  A loss  contingency is accrued in the Company\\'s consolidated  financial\\nstatements  if it is probable  that a liability has been  incurred and the amount of  the loss can be reasonably\\nestimated.  Because litigation is  inherently unpredictable and unfavorable  resolutions could occur,  assessing\\ncontingencies  is highly sensitive and  requires judgments about future events.   On at least a quarterly basis,\\nthe Company reviews contingencies related  to litigation to determine the  adequacy of accruals.  The amount  of\\nultimate loss may differ from these estimates and further events may require the Company to increase or decrease\\nthe amounts it has accrued on any matter.\\nPeriodically,  we assess  our insurance  coverage for  all known claims,  where applicable,  taking into account\\naggregate coverage by occurrence, limits of coverage, self-insured retentions and deductibles, historical claims\\nexperience and claims experience with our insurance carriers.  The liabilities are recorded at management\\'s best\\nestimate of  the  probable  outcome  of the  lawsuits  and  claims,  taking into  consideration  the  facts  and\\ncircumstances  of the individual matters as  well as past experience on  similar matters.  At each balance sheet\\ndate, the  key issues  that management  assesses are  whether  it is  probable that  a loss  as to  asserted  or\\nunasserted  claims has  been incurred and  if so, whether  the amount of  loss can be  reasonably estimated.  We\\nrecord the expected  liability with  respect to claims  in Other  liabilities and expected  recoveries from  our\\ninsurance carriers in Other assets.  We recognize a receivable when we believe that realization of the insurance\\nreceivable is probable under the terms of the insurance policies and our payment experience to date.\\nEnvironmental\\nOver  the past 20 years,  various federal and state  authorities and private parties have  claimed that we are a\\nPotentially Responsible Party ( PRP\")  as a generator of  waste materials for alleged  pollution at a number  of\\nwaste  sites  operated by  third parties  located principally  in New  Jersey and  have sought  to recover costs\\nincurred and to be incurred to clean up the sites.\\nWe  have been identified as  a PRP at eight  facilities operated by third  parties at which investigation and/or\\nremediation activities may be ongoing.  We  analyze our potential liability on  at least a quarterly basis.   We\\naccrue  for environmental liabilities when they are probable  and estimable.  We estimate our share of the total\\nfuture cost for these sites to be less than $5 million.\\n\\nWhile  joint and  several liability  is authorized under  federal and  state environmental laws,  we believe the\\namounts we have paid and  anticipate paying in the future  for clean-up costs and damages  at all sites are  not\\nmaterial  and will  not have  a material  adverse effect on  our financial  condition, results  of operations or\\nliquidity.  This assessment is  based upon, among  other things, the involvement  of other PRPs  at most of  the\\nsites,  the status  of the  proceedings, including  various settlement agreements  and consent  decrees, and the\\nextended time period over which payments will likely be  made.  There can be no assurance, however, that  future\\nevents  will not  require us  to materially  increase the amounts  we anticipate  paying for  clean-up costs and\\ndamages at these sites, and that such increased amounts will not have a material adverse effect on our financial\\ncondition, results of operations or cash flows.\\n\\n 17\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nChina Facilities\\nGuangzhou Flavors plant\\nDuring  2015, the Company was notified by Chinese authorities of compliance issues pertaining to the emission of\\nodors from several of its plants in China.  As a result, the Company\\'s Flavors facility in China was temporarily\\nidled.   Accordingly, the Company invested approximately $6.5 in odor-abatement equipment at these facilities to\\naddress these issues and is in the process of building  a second Flavors site in China, which is expected to  be\\ncompleted during 2018.  The net book value of the existing site approximates $73 million.\\nZhejiang Ingredients plant\\nThe  Company has received a request  from the Chinese government to  relocate its Fragrance Ingredients plant in\\nZhejiang, China.  The  Company is  in discussions  with the  government regarding  the timing  of the  requested\\nrelocation  and the amount and  nature of government compensation  to be provided to  the Company.  The net book\\nvalue of the current site  approximates $27 million.  Depending upon  the ultimate outcome of these  discussions\\nwith the Chinese government, between $0-27 million of the remaining net book value may be subject to accelerated\\ndepreciation.\\nTotal China Operations\\nThe  total carrying value  of our five  facilities in China (one  of which is  currently under construction) was\\napproximately $130 million as of September 30, 2016.\\nIf  the Company is  required to close a  plant, or operate  one at significantly reduced  production levels on a\\npermanent basis,  the Company  may be  required to  record charges  that could  have a  material impact  on  its\\nconsolidated financial results of operations, financial position and cash flows in future periods.\\nOther Contingencies\\nThe  Company has contingencies involving  third parties (such as  labor, contract, technology or product-related\\nclaims or  litigation)  as well  as  government-related  items in  various  jurisdictions in  which  we  operate\\npertaining to such items as value-added taxes, other indirect taxes, customs and duties and sales and use taxes.\\nIt is possible that  cash flows or results  of operations, in  any period, could be  materially affected by  the\\nunfavorable resolution of one or more of these contingencies.\\nThe most significant government-related contingencies exist in Brazil.  With regard to the Brazilian matters, we\\nbelieve we have valid  defenses for the underlying  positions under dispute; however,  in order to pursue  these\\ndefenses,  we are required to, and have provided, bank  guarantees and pledged assets in the aggregate amount of\\n$29.7 million.  The Brazilian matters take  an extended period of time  to proceed through the judicial  process\\nand there are a limited number of rulings to date.\\nIn  March 2012, ZoomEssence,  Inc.  filed a  complaint against the Company  in the U.S.   District Court for the\\nDistrict of New  Jersey alleging  trade secret  misappropriation, breach of  contract and  unjust enrichment  in\\nconnection with certain spray dry technology disclosed to the Company.  ZoomEssence is seeking an injunction and\\nmonetary damages.  ZoomEssence initially  sought a temporary restraining  order and preliminary injunction,  but\\nthe  Court denied these applications in an order entered on September 27, 2013, finding that ZoomEssence had not\\ndemonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of its claims.  On November 3, 2014, ZoomEssence amended  its\\ncomplaint against the Company to include allegations of breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, fraud\\nin the inducement, and misappropriation of confidential and proprietary information.  On November 13, 2014,  the\\nCompany  filed a  counterclaim against ZoomEssence  alleging trade secret  misappropriation, breach of contract,\\nbreach of  the  implied  covenant of  good  faith  and  fair dealing,  unjust  enrichment,  misappropriation  of\\nconfidential  and proprietary information, common law unfair competition, tortious interference with contractual\\nrelations, and conversion.  During the third quarter of 2016, the Court stayed the case and directed the parties\\nto  engage in mediation.  The mediation, which took place in October 2016, did not result in a resolution of the\\nlitigation; we cannot reliably predict  the timing of a trial,  but it is expected that  it would take place  in\\n2017.   Based on  information available  and expert  assessment of potential  exposure, the  Company recorded an\\nadditional reserve of $25 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016.\\nThe Company determines estimates of reasonably possible losses or ranges of reasonably possible losses in excess\\nof related accrued liabilities, if any,  when it has determined that either  a loss is reasonably possible or  a\\nloss  in  excess of  accrued amounts  is reasonably  possible and  the amount  of losses  or range  of losses is\\ndeterminable.  For all third  party contingencies (including labor,  contract, technology, tax,  product-related\\nclaims and business litigation), the Company currently estimates that the aggregate range of reasonably possible\\nlosses in excess of any accrued liabilities is $0 to approximately $53 million.  The estimates included in  this\\namount  are  based on  the Company\\'s  analysis of  currently available  information and,  as new  information is\\nobtained,  these  estimates  may  change.   Due  to  the  inherent  subjectivity  of  the  assessments  and  the\\nunpredictability  of outcomes of legal proceedings, any amounts accrued or included in this aggregate amount may\\nnot represent\\n\\n 18\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nthe ultimate loss to the Company from the matters in question.  Thus, the Company\\'s exposure and ultimate losses\\nmay be higher or lower, and possibly significantly so, than the amounts accrued or the range disclosed above.\\nSeparately, the Spanish tax authorities alleged claims for a capital tax and the Appellate Court rejected one of\\nthe two bases upon  which we based our  capital tax position.  On  January 22, 2014, we  filed an appeal and  in\\norder  to avoid future interest costs in the event  our appeal was unsuccessful, we paid Euro 9.8 million ($11.2\\nmillion, representing the principal amount) during the first quarter of 2014.  On February 24, 2016, we received\\na favorable  ruling on our  appeal from the  Spanish Supreme Court which  overruled a lower  court ruling.  As a\\nresult of this decision, we reversed the previously  recorded provision of Euro 9.8 million ($10.5 million)  for\\nthe  year ended December 31,  2015.  During 2016, we  recorded additional income of  $2.3 million related to the\\nfinalization of  amounts received  from  the authorities.   This  amount has  principally  been reflected  as  a\\nreduction of administrative expense.\\n\\nNote 14.  Subsequent Events:\\n\\nOn  November 3,  2016, the Company  entered into an  agreement to acquire  Fragrance Resources, a privately-held\\nfragrance company with facilities in Germany, North America, France, and China.  The transaction is expected  to\\nclose in 2017.\\n\\n 19\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nItem 2.  Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\\nOverview\\nCompany background\\nWe  create, manufacture and supply flavors and  fragrances (including cosmetic active ingredients) that are used\\nin the food,  beverage, personal  care and  household products industries  either in  the form  of compounds  or\\nindividual  ingredients, including cosmetic  active ingredients.  Our flavors  and fragrance compounds combine a\\nnumber of ingredients that are blended, mixed or reacted together to produce proprietary formulas created by our\\nflavorists and perfumers.\\nFlavors  are the key building blocks  that impart taste experiences in food  and beverage products and, as such,\\nplay a significant role in  determining consumer preference of  the end products in which  they are used.  As  a\\nleading  creator of flavors,  we help our  customers deliver on the  promise of delicious  and healthy foods and\\ndrinks that appeal to consumers.  While we are a global leader, our flavors business is more regional in nature,\\nwith  different formulas that reflect local taste preferences.  Our flavors compounds are ultimately used by our\\ncustomers in four end-use categories: (1) Savory, (2) Beverages, (3) Sweet and (4) Dairy.\\nWe  are a global leader in the creation of  fragrance compounds that are integral elements in the world\\'s finest\\nperfumes and  best-known  consumer products,  within  fabric  care, home  care,  personal wash,  hair  care  and\\ntoiletries  products.  Our Fragrances  business consists of Fragrance  Compounds and Fragrance Ingredients.  Our\\nFragrance Compounds are  defined into two  broad categories, (1)  Fine Fragrances and  (2) Consumer  Fragrances.\\nConsumer  Fragrances  consists of  five end-use  categories of  products: (1)  Fabric Care,  (2) Home  Care, (3)\\nPersonal Wash, (4) Hair Care and (5) Toiletries.  In addition, Fragrance Ingredients, which are included in  the\\nFragrances  business unit,  consist of active  and functional ingredients  that are used  internally and sold to\\nthird parties, including customers  and competitors, for  use in preparation of  compounds, and cosmetic  active\\ningredients.\\nThe  flavors and fragrances market is  part of a larger market which  supplies a wide variety of ingredients and\\ncompounds that are  used in consumer  products.  The broader  market includes large  multinational companies  or\\nsmaller  regional and local participants which supply products such as seasonings, texturizers, spices, enzymes,\\ncertain food-related commodities,  fortified products and  cosmetic active ingredients.   The global market  for\\nflavors and fragrances has expanded consistently, primarily as a result of an increase in demand for, as well as\\nan increase in the variety of,  consumer products containing flavors and  fragrances.  In 2014, the flavors  and\\nfragrances market, in which we compete, was estimated by management to be at least $18 billion and is forecasted\\nto grow to approximately $21.6 billion by 2019, primarily driven by expected growth in emerging markets; however\\nthe  exact size of the global market is not available due to fragmentation of data.  We estimate the market size\\nfor cosmetic active ingredients to be  approximately $1.5 billion as of 2015.   We, together with the other  top\\nthree  companies, are estimated to represent approximately two-thirds of the total estimated sales in the global\\nflavors and fragrances sub-segment of the broader market.\\nOn  October 7, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition  of 100% of the outstanding shares of David Michael &\\nCompany, Inc.  (\"David Michael\") for  approximately $242 million.  The purchase  price was funded from  existing\\nresources.  David Michael was acquired to strengthen the North American flavors business.  This acquisition will\\nbe accounted for as a  business combination and is  not expected to have a  material impact on the  consolidated\\nstatement of comprehensive income for 2016.\\nDuring  the second quarter of 2015, we completed the  acquisition of Ottens Flavors, and in the third quarter of\\n2015, we completed  the acquisition of  Lucas Meyer.  The  acquisitions did not  have a material  impact on  our\\nconsolidated statement of comprehensive income either individually or in aggregate.\\n2016 Overview\\nNet  sales during the third quarter of 2016 increased 2%  on a reported basis and 3% on a currency neutral basis\\n(which excludes the effects of changes in currency), with the effect of the Lucas Meyer acquisition contributing\\napproximately  1% to both reported and  currency neutral basis growth rates.   The currency neutral growth of 3%\\nreflects new win performance  (net of losses) in  Flavors and Fragrance Compounds  in addition to strong  growth\\ndriven  by the impact of acquisitions in Fragrance  Ingredients and lower volume erosion on existing business in\\nFlavors.\\nExchange  rate fluctuations had a 100  basis point (bps) unfavorable impact on  net sales for the third quarter,\\ndue to the strengthening of  the U.S.  dollar.  The  effect of exchange rates can  vary by business and  region,\\ndepending  upon the mix of sales by destination country as well as the relative percentage of local sales priced\\nin U.S.  dollars versus local currencies.\\nGross  margins decreased  year-over-year to 44.6%  in the third  quarter of 2016  from 45.4% in  the 2015 period\\ndriven primarily by unfavorable mix, manufacturing performance and input costs which were only partially  offset\\nby cost savings and\\n\\n 20\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nproductivity  initiatives.  Included in  the third quarter of  2016 was $1.0 million  of restructuring costs and\\noperational improvement initiative costs, compared to $2.7 million of costs associated with  acquisition-related\\nand  operational improvement  initiative costs included  in the third  quarter of 2015.   Excluding these items,\\ngross margin decreased 100 bps compared to the prior year period.  The overall raw material cost base  continues\\nto  be essentially benign.  We believe that we will continue to see higher prices on certain categories (such as\\nnaturals including vanilla) that will be largely  offset by benefits associated with oil-based derivatives  that\\nare  expected  to  continue in  2016.   We continue  to  seek improvements  in  our margins  through operational\\nperformance, cost reduction efforts and mix enhancement.\\nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW\\nSales\\nReported  sales in  the third  quarter of  2016 increased  approximately 2%.   In currency  neutral terms, sales\\nincreased 3%, reflecting new win  performance in both Flavors and  Fragrance Compounds, lower volume erosion  on\\nexisting business in Flavors and the effect of the Lucas Meyer acquisition (which added approximately 1% to both\\nreported and currency neutral basis amounts) in Fragrance Ingredients.  We continue to benefit from our  diverse\\nportfolio  of end-use product  categories and geographies and  had currency neutral growth  in three of our four\\nregions and all four of our end-use product categories.  Flavors realized currency neutral growth of 3% for  the\\nthird  quarter of 2016, which was  driven by new win performance and  lower volume erosion on existing business.\\nOur Fragrance  business achieved  currency  neutral growth  of  2%, driven  primarily  by strong  growth  within\\nFragrance  Ingredients, which was driven entirely by  the inclusion of acquisitions.  Overall, our third quarter\\n2016 results include 5% growth from emerging markets and 2% growth from developed markets which represented  49%\\nand  51% of currency neutral  sales, respectively.  From a geographic  perspective, for the third quarter, North\\nAmerica (NOAM), Europe, Africa and the Middle East  (EAME) and Greater Asia (GA) all delivered currency  neutral\\ngrowth in 2016, led by GA with 7%.  Latin America (LA) sales declined 4% on a currency neutral basis.\\nOperating profit\\nOperating  profit decreased $32.3 million to $124.3 million  (16.0% of sales) in the 2016 third quarter compared\\nto $156.7 million (20.5%  of sales) in  the comparable 2015 period.   The third quarter  of 2016 included  $26.8\\nmillion  of  legal  charges, acquisition-related,  operational  improvement initiative  and  restructuring costs\\ncompared to $7.1 million of acquisition-related and  operational improvement initiative costs in the prior  year\\nperiod.   Excluding these charges, adjusted  operating profit was $151.1 million  (19.4% of sales) for the third\\nquarter of 2016,  a decrease  from $163.8  million (21.4%  of sales)  for the  third quarter  of 2015.   Foreign\\ncurrency  changes had a 4% unfavorable impact on operating  profit in the 2016 period compared to an unfavorable\\nimpact on operating profit of approximately 3% in the 2015 period versus the 2014 period.\\nOther (income) expense, net\\nOther  (income) expense,  net increased  $4.2 million to  $2.2 million  of income in  the third  quarter of 2016\\ncompared to $2.0 million  of expense in  the third quarter  of 2015.  The  year-over-year increase is  primarily\\ndriven by favorable year-over-year foreign exchange gains in 2016.\\nNet income\\nNet  income decreased  by $16.7  million quarter-over-quarter to  $89.8 million  for the third  quarter of 2016,\\ndriven by the factors discussed above.\\nCash flows\\nCash  flows from operations for the nine months ended  September 30, 2016 were $329.4 million or 14.0% of sales,\\ncompared to cash inflow from operations of $294.7 million or 12.8% of sales for the nine months ended  September\\n30,  2015.   The  increase in  cash  flows from  operations  in 2016  was  principally driven  by  lower pension\\ncontributions and lower core working capital requirements (trade receivables, inventories and accounts  payable)\\nfor the 2016 period as compared to the 2015 period.\\n\\n 21\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nResults of Operations\\n\\n                                              Three Months Ended September 30,                    Nine Months Ended September 30,\\n(DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS                         2016                  2015              Change      2016                   2015                 Change\\nEXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS)\\nNet sales                                     $      777,001        $    765,092      2     %     $     2,353,790        $     2,307,540      2     %\\nCost of goods sold                            430,733               417,966           3     %     1,281,673              1,269,097            1     %\\nGross profit                                  346,268               347,126                       1,072,117              1,038,443\\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses       64,415                62,750            3     %     191,052                188,725              1     %\\nSelling and administrative (S&A) expenses     152,046               122,249           24    %     408,372                372,267              10    %\\nAmortization of acquisition-related           5,468                 5,414             1     %     16,659                 10,293               62    %\\nintangibles\\nRestructuring and other charges, net                                                        %                            (170             )   (100  )%\\nOperating profit                              124,339               156,713                       456,034                467,328\\nInterest expense                              13,111                11,855            11    %     40,649                 34,357               18    %\\nOther (income) expense                        (2,162          )     1,959             (210  )%    (4,952           )     (3,315           )   49    %\\nIncome before taxes                           113,390               142,899                       420,337                436,286\\nTaxes on income                               23,613                36,452            (35   )%    95,223                 96,206               (1    )%\\nNet income                                    $      89,777         $    106,447      (16   )%    $     325,114          $     340,080        (4    )%\\nDiluted EPS                                   $      1.12           $    1.31         (15   )%    $     4.05             $     4.18           (3    )%\\nGross margin                                  44.6            %     45.4          %   (80   )     45.5             %     45.0             %   50\\nR&D as a percentage of sales                  8.3             %     8.2           %   10          8.1              %     8.2              %   (10   )\\nS&A as a percentage of sales                  19.6            %     16.0          %   360         17.3             %     16.1             %   120\\nOperating margin                              16.0            %     20.5          %   (450  )     19.4             %     20.3             %   (90   )\\nAdjusted operating margin                     19.4            %     21.4          %   (200  )     20.6             %     20.9             %   (30   )\\nEffective tax rate                            20.8            %     25.5          %   (470  )     22.7             %     22.1             %   60\\nSegment net sales\\nFlavors                                       $      366,857        $    359,103      2     %     $     1,118,869        $     1,108,689      1     %\\nFragrances                                    410,144               405,989           1     %     1,234,921              1,198,851            3     %\\nConsolidated                                  $      777,001        $    765,092                  $     2,353,790        $     2,307,540\\n \\n(1)  Adjusted operating margin excludes $26.8 million consisting of legal charges, acquisition-related, operational improvement initiative and\\n     restructuring costs for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and excludes $7.1 million acquisition-related and operational improvement\\n     initiative costs for the three months ended September 30, 2015.

The currency neutral increase was due to mid single-digit growth in three of four\\nend-use categories.  The Flavors business delivered  currency neutral growth in EAME and  LA and GA, led by  LA.\\nSales  in LA were led by double-digit gains in  Savory, Sweet and Dairy.  EAME sales were driven by double-digit\\ngains in Savory and Sweet, which were only partially offset by high single-digit declines in Beverage.

In\\nthe  third quarter of 2016, Global expenses were $11.4 million compared to $6.9 million during the third quarter\\nof 2015.

On\\na currency neutral basis sales increased 4%,  as a result of new win  performance in both Flavors and  Fragrance\\nCompounds, in addition to strong growth in Fragrance Ingredients, driven by the impact of acquisitions and lower\\nvolume erosion on existing business in  Flavors.  On both a reported and  currency neutral basis, the effect  of\\nacquisitions was approximately 2% to net sales amounts.  Overall currency neutral growth included 4% growth from\\nboth developed and emerging markets.\\nFlavors Business Unit\\nFlavors  reported sales  increased 1% against  the prior year  period while currency  neutral sales increased 4%\\nduring the first nine months of 2016 compared to  the 2015 period, with approximately half of the growth  driven\\nby  the inclusion of acquisitions in both reported and currency neutral basis amounts.  In addition, the overall\\nperformance reflects new win performance and lower volume erosion.  The currency neutral increase was due to low\\nto  mid single-digit  growth in all  four end-use categories.   The Flavors business  delivered currency neutral\\ngrowth in all four regions, led by NOAM and GA.  Sales in NOAM were led by high single-digit gains in Sweet  and\\nlow  single-digit gains in Beverage.  Sales in GA were driven by high single-digit gains in Dairy as well as mid\\nsingle-digit gains in Sweet and Beverage.  LA sales were driven by double-digit gains in Savory and Dairy.  EAME\\nsales were driven by mid to high single-digit gains in Sweet and Dairy.\\nFragrances Business Unit\\nThe  Fragrances business experienced an increase  of 3% in reported sales and  a 5% increase in currency neutral\\nsales for the first nine months of 2016 compared  to the 2015 period.  Acquisitions accounted for primarily  all\\nof  the growth on a reported basis and approximately  two-thirds of the growth on a currency neutral basis.  The\\noverall currency neutral increase was primarily driven by double-digit growth in Fragrance Ingredients, which is\\ndriven  entirely by the inclusion  of acquisitions, as well  as mid single-digit growth  in Fabric Care and high\\nsingle-digit growth  in Personal  Wash.

The increase was largely  due to a benefit of  $10.5 million recorded in  the\\nfirst  nine months of  2015, as a result  of favorable tax  rulings in Spain and  another jurisdiction for which\\nreserves were  previously recorded  and  higher loss  provisions in  2016,  partially offset  by lower  cost  of\\nrepatriation  in the 2016 period.  Excluding the $9.4  million tax benefit associated with pretax legal charges,\\nrestructuring, operational  improvement initiatives  and  acquisition-related costs,  the 2016  period  adjusted\\neffective  tax rate was 23.3%, or 80  bps lower than the 2015 period  adjusted effective tax rate of 24.1%.  The\\n2015 adjusted effective  tax rate excluded  $2.0 million of  tax benefit associated  with pretax  restructuring,\\noperational improvement initiative and acquisition-related costs and the $10.5 million settlement related to the\\nfavorable tax ruling discussed above.\\n\\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\\nCASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS\\nWe  had cash and cash equivalents of $498.7 million at September 30, 2016 compared to $182.0 million at December\\n31, 2015, of which $239.8 million of the balance at September 30, 2016 was held outside the United States.  Cash\\nbalances  held in foreign  jurisdictions are, in most  circumstances, available to be  repatriated to the United\\nStates; however, they  would be  subject to  United States  federal income  taxes, less  applicable foreign  tax\\ncredits.   We have not provided  U.S.  income tax expense on  substantially all of the accumulated undistributed\\nearnings of our foreign subsidiaries because we have the ability and plan to reinvest these indefinitely.\\nEffective  utilization of the cash generated by our  international operations is a critical component of our tax\\nstrategy.  Strategic dividend repatriation from foreign subsidiaries creates U.S.  taxable income, which enables\\nus  to  realize deferred  tax assets.   The Company  regularly repatriates,  in the  form of  dividends from its\\nnon-U.S.  subsidiaries, a portion of its current year earnings to fund financial obligations in the U.S.\\n\\nCASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES\\nNet cash provided by operating activities in the first nine months of 2016 was $329.4 million compared to $294.7\\nmillion in the first nine  months of 2015.  The increase  in operating cash flows for  the first nine months  of\\n2016  compared to  2015 was  principally driven by  lower pension  contributions and lower  core working capital\\nrequirements in the 2016 period as compared to 2015 period.\\nWorking  capital  (current assets  less current  liabilities) totaled  $1,001.1 million  at September  30, 2016,\\ncompared to $712.0 million at December 31, 2015.  The Company sold certain accounts receivable on a non-recourse\\nbasis   to  unrelated  financial  institutions  under  factoring\"  agreements  that  are  sponsored,  solely and\\nindividually, by certain customers.   We believe that  participating in the  factoring programs strengthens  our\\nrelationships  with  these  customers and  provides  operational efficiencies.   The  beneficial impact  on cash\\nprovided by operations from participating in these  programs increased approximately $25.8 million for the  nine\\nmonths  ended September 30, 2016 compared to an increase of approximately $0.2 million for the nine months ended\\nSeptember 30, 2015.  The cost of participating in these programs was immaterial to our results in all periods.\\nCASH FLOWS USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES\\nNet  investing activities during the first nine months of  2016 used $66.2 million compared to $546.1 million in\\nthe prior year period.  The decrease in cash used in investing activities principally reflects the  acquisitions\\nof Ottens Flavors and Lucas Meyer during the 2015 period.  Additions to property, plant and equipment were $70.2\\nmillion during the first nine  months of 2016 compared to  $66.6 million in the first  nine months of 2015.   We\\nexpect additions to property, plant and equipment will be approximately 5% of our sales (net of potential grants\\nand other reimbursements from government authorities) in 2016.\\nCASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES\\nNet  financing activities  in the first  nine months of  2016 remained flat  with $65.8 million  of cash inflows\\ncompared to $66.9 million of cash  inflows in the first nine months  of 2015, reflecting higher borrowings  that\\nwere  offset by the repayment of our Senior Notes -  2006 as well as higher dividend payments and treasury stock\\nrepurchases in 2016.\\n\\n 28\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAt  September 30, 2016, we had $1,367.9 million  of debt outstanding compared to $1,067.7 million outstanding at\\nDecember 31, 2015.\\nWe paid dividends totaling $134.1 million in the 2016 period.  We declared a cash dividend per share of $0.64 in\\nthe third quarter of 2016  that was paid on October  6, 2016 to all shareholders  of record as of September  26,\\n2016.\\nIn  December 2012, the Board of Directors authorized a $250 million share repurchase program, which commenced in\\nthe first quarter of 2013.   In August 2015, the  Board of Directors approved  an additional $250 million  share\\nrepurchase authorization and extension through December 31, 2017.  Based on the total remaining amount of $142.6\\nmillion available under  the amended repurchase  program, approximately 1.0  million shares, or  1.3% of  shares\\noutstanding  (based on the  market price and shares  outstanding as of September  30, 2016) could be repurchased\\nunder the program as of September 30, 2016.  The purchases will be made from time to time on the open market  or\\nthrough  private transactions as market and business conditions warrant.  Repurchased shares will be placed into\\ntreasury stock.  During the  three months ended September  30, 2016, we repurchased  167,307 shares on the  open\\nmarket  at an aggregate cost of $22.4 million or an  average of $134.08 per share.  During the nine months ended\\nSeptember 30, 2016, we repurchased 789,531 shares on the open market at an aggregate cost of $94.1 million or an\\naverage  of $119.24 per share.  The ultimate level of  purchases will be a function of the daily purchase limits\\nestablished in the pre-approved program according to the share price at that time.\\nCAPITAL RESOURCES\\nOperating  cash  flow provides  the primary  source of  funds for  capital investment  needs, dividends  paid to\\nshareholders and debt  repayments.  We anticipate  that cash flows  from operations and  availability under  our\\nexisting  credit facilities  are sufficient  to meet  our investing and  financing needs  for at  least the next\\neighteen months.   We  regularly  assess our  capital  structure,  including both  current  and  long-term  debt\\ninstruments,  as compared to our cash generation and  investment needs in order to provide ample flexibility and\\nto optimize our leverage ratios.  We believe our existing cash balances are sufficient to meet our debt  service\\nrequirements.\\nWe  supplement short-term liquidity  with access to  capital markets, mainly through  bank credit facilities and\\nissuance of commercial paper.  We did not issue commercial  paper during the first nine months of 2016 or  2015.\\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2016, we issued $50 million face value of commercial paper.\\nWe  expect to contribute a total of approximately $30  million to our non-U.S.  pension plans and $20 million to\\nour U.S.   pension  plans  during  2016.  During  the  nine  months  ended September  30,  2016,  $20.0  million\\ncontributions  were made to our qualified  U.S.  pension plans and $21.1  million contributions were made to our\\nnon-U.S.  pension plans.\\nOn  March 14, 2016, we issued Euro 500.0 million face  amount of 1.75% Senior Notes (\"Euro Senior Notes - 2016\")\\ndue 2024 at a discount of Euro 0.9 million.  The Company received proceeds related to the issuance of these Euro\\nSenior  Notes - 2016 of Euro 496.0  million which was net of the Euro  0.9 million discount and Euro 3.1 million\\nunderwriting discount (recorded as deferred financing costs).  In addition, the Company incurred $1.3 million of\\nother  deferred financing costs in connection with the debt issuance.  The discount and deferred financing costs\\nare being amortized as interest expense over the term of the Euro Senior Notes - 2016.  The Euro Senior Notes  -\\n2016  bear interest at a rate of 1.75% per annum,  with interest payable on March 14 of each year, commencing on\\nMarch 14, 2017.  The Euro  Senior Notes - 2016 will  mature on March 14, 2024.   See Note 6 to the  Consolidated\\nFinancial Statements for further information.\\n\\nDuring the third quarter of 2016, the Company made final payment of $125.0 million on our Senior Notes - 2006.\\nAs  of September 30, 2016,  we had no borrowings  under our revolving credit facility.   The amount which we are\\nable to draw down on  under the facility is  limited by financial covenants as  described in more detail  below.\\nOur draw down capacity on the facility was $950.0 million at September 30, 2016.\\nUnder  our revolving credit facility, we are required to maintain, at the end of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of\\nnet debt for borrowed money to adjusted EBITDA in respect of the previous 12-month period of not more than  3.25\\nto 1.  Based on this ratio, at September 30, 2016 our covenant compliance provided overall borrowing capacity of\\n$1,525 million.\\nAt  September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with  all financial and other covenants, including the net debt to\\nadjusted EBITDA  ratio.  At  September 30,  2016 our  Net Debt/adjusted  EBITDA ratio,  as defined  by the  debt\\nagreements,  was 1.18 to 1, well below the  financial covenants of existing outstanding debt.  Failure to comply\\nwith the financial and other covenants  under our debt agreements would  constitute default and would allow  the\\nlenders  to accelerate the maturity of all indebtedness  under the related agreement.  If such acceleration were\\nto occur, we would not have sufficient liquidity available  to repay the indebtedness.  We would likely have  to\\nseek amendments under the agreements for relief from the financial covenants or repay\\n\\n 29\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nthe  debt with proceeds from  the issuance of new debt  or equity, and/or asset sales,  if necessary.  We may be\\nunable to amend the agreements or raise sufficient capital to repay such obligations in the event the maturities\\nare accelerated.\\n\\n(1)  Adjusted EBITDA and Net Debt, which are non-GAAP measures used for these covenants, are calculated in accordance with the definition in the debt\\n     agreements. In this context, these measures are used solely to provide information on the extent to which we are in compliance with debt covenants\\n     and may not be comparable to adjusted EBITDA and Net Debt used by other companies. Reconciliations of adjusted EBITDA to net income and net debt to\\n     total debt are as follows:\\n \\n                               Twelve Months Ended September 30,\\n(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS)          2016                   2015\\nNet income                     $      404.2           $    430.2\\nInterest expense               52.4                   46.4\\nIncome taxes                   118.9                  123.6\\nDepreciation and amortization  99.5                   86.0\\nSpecified items                40.0                   0.2\\nNon-cash items                 21.0                   19.7\\nAdjusted EBITDA                $      736.0           $    706.1\\n \\n(1)  Specified items for the 12 months ended September 30, 2016 of $40.0 million consist of the legal charge related to the ZoomEssence reserve recorded\\n     in the third quarter of 2016 as well as costs associated with restructuring and the acceleration of the contingent consideration related to the\\n     Aromor acquisition as discussed in our 2015 Form 10-K.\\n \\n(2)  Non-cash items represent all other adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operations as presented on the Statement of Cash\\n     Flows, including gain on disposal of assets, stock-based compensation and pension settlement/curtailment.\\n \\n                                      September 30,\\n(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS)                 2016                2015\\nTotal debt                            $    1,367.9        $    1,191.0\\nAdjustments:\\nDeferred gain on interest rate swaps  (1.8          )     (3.7          )\\nCash and cash equivalents             (498.7        )     (272.3        )\\nNet debt                              $    867.4          $    915.0\\nAs  discussed in Note 13  to the Consolidated Financial  Statements, at September 30,  2016, we had entered into\\nvarious  guarantees  and  had  undrawn  outstanding  letters  of  credit  from  financial  institutions.

Accordingly, we undertake no obligation to publicly update  or\\nrevise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.\\n\\nAny  public statements  or disclosures by  the Company following  this report that  modify or impact  any of the\\nforward-looking statements contained in or accompanying this report  will be deemed to modify or supersede  such\\noutlook or other forward-looking statements in or accompanying this report.\\nThe foregoing list of important factors does not include all such factors, nor necessarily present them in order\\nof importance.  In addition,  you should consult  other disclosures made by  the Company (such  as in our  other\\nfilings  with the SEC or  in company press releases)  for other factors that may  cause actual results to differ\\nmaterially from those projected by the  Company.  Please refer to Part I.   Item 1A., Risk Factors, of the  2015\\nForm  10-K for additional information  regarding factors that could affect  our results of operations, financial\\ncondition and cash flow.\\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\\nThe Company uses non-GAAP financial operating measures in this Quarterly Report, including: (i) currency neutral\\nsales (which eliminates the effects that result from translating its international sales in U.S.  dollars), (ii)\\nadjusted   operating   profit   and   adjusted   operating  margin   (which   excludes   legal  charges/credits,\\nacquisition-related costs,  operational improvement  initiative costs,  restructuring charges),  (iii)  adjusted\\nselling  and administrative expenses (which excludes legal charges/credits) and (iv) adjusted effective tax rate\\n(which excludes legal charges/credits, acquisition-related  costs, operational improvement initiative costs  and\\nrestructuring charges).  The Company also provides the non-GAAP measures adjusted EBITDA (which excludes certain\\nspecified items and  non-cash items  as set  forth in  the Company\\'s  debt agreements)  and net  debt (which  is\\nadjusted  for deferred  gain on interest  rate swaps and  cash and cash  equivalents) solely for  the purpose of\\nproviding information on the extent to which the Company  is in compliance with debt covenants contained in  its\\ndebt agreements.\\nWe  have included  each of  these non-GAAP  measures in  order to  provide additional  information regarding our\\nunderlying operating results  and comparable year-over-year  performance.  Such information  is supplemental  to\\ninformation presented in accordance with GAAP and is not intended to represent a presentation in accordance with\\nGAAP.  In discussing our historical\\n\\n 31\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nand  expected future results and financial condition, we believe it is meaningful for investors to be made aware\\nof and to be assisted in  a better understanding of, on  a period-to-period comparable basis, financial  amounts\\nboth  including and excluding these identified  items, as well as the  impact of exchange rate fluctuations.  We\\nbelieve   such  additional  non-GAAP  information  provides   investors  with  an  overall  perspective  of  the\\nperiod-to-period performance of our business.  In addition, management internally reviews each of these non-GAAP\\nmeasures to evaluate  performance on  a comparative  period-to-period basis  in terms  of absolute  performance,\\ntrends  and expected future performance  with respect to our business.   A material limitation of these non-GAAP\\nmeasures is that such measures do not reflect actual GAAP amounts.  We compensate for such limitations by  using\\nthese  measures  as  one of  several  metrics, including  GAAP  measures.  These  non-GAAP  measures may  not be\\ncomparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\\n\\nA.

OTHER INFORMATION\\n\\nItem 1.  Legal Proceedings\\nWe are subject to various claims and legal actions in the ordinary course of our business.\\nTax Claims\\nThe  Spanish tax authorities alleged  claims for a capital  tax and the Appellate Court  rejected one of the two\\nbases upon which we based  our capital tax position.  On  January 22, 2014, we filed  an appeal and in order  to\\navoid  future interest costs in the event our appeal  was unsuccessful, we paid Euro 9.8 million ($11.2 million,\\nrepresenting the principal  amount) during  the first  quarter of 2014.   On February  24, 2016,  we received  a\\nfavorable ruling on our appeal from the Spanish Supreme Court which overruled a lower court ruling.  As a result\\nof this decision, we reversed the previously recorded provision of Euro 9.8 million ($10.5 million) for the year\\nended December 31, 2015.  During 2016, we recorded additional income of $2.3 million related to the finalization\\nof amounts  received from  the  authorities.  This  amount has  been  principally reflected  as a  reduction  of\\nadministrative expense.\\n\\nEnvironmental\\nOver  the past 20 years,  various federal and state  authorities and private parties have  claimed that we are a\\nPotentially Responsible Party ( PRP\")  as a generator of  waste materials for alleged  pollution at a number  of\\nwaste  sites  operated by  third parties  located principally  in New  Jersey and  have sought  to recover costs\\nincurred and to be incurred to clean up the sites.\\nWe  have been identified as  a PRP at eight  facilities operated by third  parties at which investigation and/or\\nremediation activities may be ongoing.  We  analyze our potential liability on  at least a quarterly basis.   We\\naccrue  for environmental liabilities when they are probable  and estimable.  We estimate our share of the total\\nfuture cost for these sites to be less than $5 million.\\nWhile  joint and  several liability  is authorized under  federal and  state environmental laws,  we believe the\\namounts we have paid and  anticipate paying in the future  for clean-up costs and damages  at all sites are  not\\nmaterial  and will  not have  a material  adverse effect on  our financial  condition, results  of operations or\\nliquidity.  This assessment is  based upon, among  other things, the involvement  of other PRPs  at most of  the\\nsites,  the status  of the  proceedings, including  various settlement agreements  and consent  decrees, and the\\nextended time period over which payments will likely be  made.  There can be no assurance, however, that  future\\nevents  will not  require us  to materially  increase the amounts  we anticipate  paying for  clean-up costs and\\ndamages at these sites, and that such increased amounts will not have a material adverse effect on our financial\\ncondition, results of operations or cash flows.\\nOther\\n\\n 36\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIn  March 2012, ZoomEssence,  Inc.  filed a  complaint against the Company  in the U.S.   District Court for the\\nDistrict of New  Jersey alleging  trade secret  misappropriation, breach of  contract and  unjust enrichment  in\\nconnection with certain spray dry technology disclosed to the Company.  ZoomEssence is seeking an injunction and\\nmonetary damages.  ZoomEssence initially  sought a temporary restraining  order and preliminary injunction,  but\\nthe  Court denied these applications in an order entered on September 27, 2013, finding that ZoomEssence had not\\ndemonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of its claims.  On November 3, 2014, ZoomEssence amended  its\\ncomplaint against the Company to include allegations of breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, fraud\\nin the inducement, and misappropriation of confidential and proprietary information.  On November 13, 2014,  the\\nCompany  filed a  counterclaim against ZoomEssence  alleging trade secret  misappropriation, breach of contract,\\nbreach of  the  implied  covenant of  good  faith  and  fair dealing,  unjust  enrichment,  misappropriation  of\\nconfidential  and proprietary information, common law unfair competition, tortious interference with contractual\\nrelations, and conversion.  During the third quarter of 2016, the Court stayed the case and directed the parties\\nto  engage in mediation.  The mediation, which took place in October 2016, did not result in a resolution of the\\nlitigation; we cannot reliably predict  the timing of a trial,  but it is expected that  it would take place  in\\n2017.   Based on  information available  and expert  assessment of potential  exposure, the  Company recorded an\\nadditional reserve of $25 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016.\\nWe  are also a party to other litigations arising in  the ordinary course of our business.  We do not expect the\\noutcome of these cases,  singly or in  the aggregate, to have  a material effect  on our consolidated  financial\\ncondition.\\n\\nItem 2.

Accordingly, Inventory and Accounts payable decreased by $17.0 million. This adjustment was not material to\\n                                   the previously issued financial statements.\\n                                   Recent Accounting Pronouncements\\n                                   In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\") issued authoritative guidance which requires\\n                                   changes to the classification of certain activities within the statement of cash flows. This guidance will be\\n                                   effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption will be permitted for all\\n                                   entities. The Company does not expect this adoption will have a significant impact on its statement of cash flows.\\n                                   In March 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which requires changes to several aspects of the accounting for\\n                                   share-based payment transactions, including the treatment of income tax consequences, classification of awards as\\n                                   either equity or liabilities, and classification of certain items on the statement of cash flows. This guidance will\\n                                   be effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption will be permitted for\\n                                   all entities. Among other changes, the standard requires that employee taxes paid when an employer withholds shares\\n                                   be presented in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows as a financing activity instead of an operating activity.\\n                                   The Company expects to adopt this change retroactively and that the impact of this aspect of the standard on the\\n                                   Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows will be approximately $20-$25 million on an annual basis. The Company is\\n                                   currently evaluating the other changes required by the standard.\\n                                   In February 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which requires changes to the accounting for leases. The new\\n                                   guidance establishes a new lease accounting model, that requires entities to record assets and liabilities related to\\n                                   leases on the balance sheet for certain types of leases. The guidance will be effective for annual and interim\\n                                   periods beginning after December 31, 2018. Early adoption will be permitted for all entities. The Company expects the\\n                                   adoption of this guidance will result in significant increases to assets and liabilities on its Consolidated Balance\\n                                   Sheet and is still evaluating the impact on its Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.\\n                                   In September 2015, the FASB issued authoritative guidance relating to the adjustments made during the measurement\\n                                   period for items in a business combination. Specifically, the new guidance requires adjustments related to the\\n                                   finalization of estimates to be recorded in the period when they are determined and to provide certain additional\\n                                   disclosures. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company adopted this\\n                                   guidance during 2016 and the adoption did not have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.\\n                                   In April 2015, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized\\n                                   debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt\\n                                   liability. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company\\n                                   adopted this guidance retrospectively in 2016 and accordingly has reclassified all debt issuance costs on long-term\\n                                   debt as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of\\n                                   December 31, 2015. The adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on its consolidated financial\\n                                   statements.\\n                                   In May 2014, the FASB issued authoritative guidance to clarify the principles to be used to recognize revenue and\\n                                   made subsequent clarifications under the new requirements during May 2016. The guidance is applicable to all entities\\n                                   and is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Adoption as of the original\\n                                   effective date is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that this new standard will have on its\\n                                   consolidated financial statements.\\n                                   Accounts Receivable\\n                                   The Company sells certain accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis to unrelated financial institutions under\\n                                   factoring\" agreements that are sponsored, solely and individually, by certain customers. The Company accounts for\\n                                   these transactions as sales of receivables, removes the receivables sold from its financial statements, and records\\n                                   cash proceeds when received by the Company. The beneficial impact on cash provided by operations from participating\\n                                   in these programs increased approximately $25.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to an\\n                                   increase of approximately $0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The cost of participating in\\n                                   these programs was immaterial to our results in all periods.\\nX\\n - References\\n \\nNo definition available.\\n \\n+ Details\\nName:             us-gaap_AccountingPoliciesAbstract\\nNamespace Prefix: us-gaap_\\nData Type:        xbrli:stringItemType\\nBalance Type:     na\\nPeriod Type:      duration\\nX\\n - Definition\\n \\nThe entire disclosure for organization, consolidation and basis of presentation of financial statements disclosure.\\n \\n+ References\\n \\nReference 1: http://www.xbrl.org/2003/role/presentationRef\\n-Publisher FASB\\n-Name Accounting Standards Codification\\n-Topic 205\\n-SubTopic 10\\n-Section 45\\n-Paragraph 3\\n-URI http://asc.fasb.org/extlink&oid=35735333&loc=d3e288-107754\\n \\nReference 2: http://www.xbrl.org/2003/role/presentationRef\\n-Publisher FASB\\n-Name Accounting Standards Codification\\n-Topic 235\\n-SubTopic 10\\n-Section 50\\n-Paragraph 3\\n-URI http://asc.fasb.org/extlink&oid=51655414&loc=d3e18780-107790\\n \\nReference 3: http://www.xbrl.org/2003/role/presentationRef\\n-Publisher FASB\\n-Name Accounting Standards Codification\\n-Topic 272\\n-SubTopic 10\\n-Section 50\\n-Paragraph 3\\n-URI http://asc.fasb.org/extlink&oid=6373374&loc=d3e70478-108055\\n \\nReference 4: http://www.xbrl.org/2003/role/presentationRef\\n-Publisher FASB\\n-Name Accounting Standards Codification\\n-Topic 810\\n-SubTopic 10\\n-Section 50\\n-Paragraph 1\\n-URI http://asc.fasb.org/extlink&oid=18733093&loc=d3e5614-111684\\n \\nReference 5: http://www.xbrl.org/2003/role/presentationRef\\n-Publisher FASB\\n-Name Accounting Standards Codification\\n-Topic 205\\n-SubTopic 10\\n-Section 50\\n-Paragraph 1\\n-URI http://asc.fasb.org/extlink&oid=6359566&loc=d3e326-107755\\n \\n+ Details\\nName:             us-gaap_OrganizationConsolidationAndPresentationOfFinancialStatementsDisclosureTextBlock\\nNamespace Prefix: us-gaap_\\nData Type:        nonnum:textBlockItemType\\nBalance Type:     na\\nPeriod Type:      duration\\n</html>\\n</TEXT>\\n</DOCUMENT>\\n<DOCUMENT>\\n<TYPE>XML\\n<SEQUENCE>17\\nIDEA: XBRL DOCUMENT\\n\\nNet Income Per Share       9 Months Ended\\n                           Sep. 30, 2016\\nEarnings Per Share\\n[Abstract]\\nNet Income Per Share       Net Income Per Share:\\n                           Net income per share is based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding.

Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our market\\n             assumptions. These two types of inputs create the following fair value hierarchy:\\n \\n              Level 1 Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.\\n \\n              Level 2 Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and\\n              model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets.\\n \\n              Level 3 Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.\\n             This hierarchy requires us to use observable market data, when available, and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair value. We\\n             determine the fair value of structured liabilities (where performance is linked to structured interest rates, inflation or currency risks) using the\\n             LIBOR swap curve and forward interest and exchange rates at period end. Such instruments are classified as Level 2 based on the observability of\\n             significant inputs to the model. We do not have any instruments classified as Level 1 or Level 3, other than those included in pension asset trusts as\\n             discussed in Note 13 of our 2015 Form 10-K.\\n             These valuations take into consideration our credit risk and our counterparties\\' credit risk.

These\\n             contracts generally involve the exchange of one currency for a second currency at a future date, have maturities not exceeding twelve months and are\\n             with counterparties which are major international financial institutions.\\n \\n             During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company entered into several forward currency contracts which\\n             qualified as net investment hedges, in order to mitigate a portion of our net European investments from foreign currency risk. The effective portions of\\n             net investment hedges are recorded in Other comprehensive income ( OCI\") as a component of Foreign currency translation adjustments in the accompanying\\n             Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. Realized gains (losses) are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (\"AOCI\") where they will\\n             remain until the net investments in our European subsidiaries are divested. The outstanding forward currency contracts have remaining maturities of\\n             approximately one year. Twelve of these forward currency contracts matured during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.\\n \\n             Subsequent to the issuance of the Euro Senior Notes - 2016 during the first quarter of 2016, the Company designated the debt as a hedge of a portion of\\n             its net European investments. Accordingly, the change in the value of the debt that is attributable to foreign exchange movements is recorded in OCI as\\n             a component of Foreign currency translation adjustments in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.\\n \\n             During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company entered into several forward currency contracts which\\n             qualified as cash flow hedges. The objective of these hedges is to protect against the currency risk associated with forecasted U.S. dollar (USD)\\n             denominated raw material purchases made by Euro (EUR) functional currency entities which result from changes in the EUR/USD exchange rate. The effective\\n             portions of cash flow hedges are recorded in OCI as a component of gains/(losses) on derivatives qualifying as hedges in the accompanying Consolidated\\n             Statement of Comprehensive Income. Realized gains/(losses) in AOCI related to cash flow hedges of raw material purchases are recognized as a component\\n             of Cost of goods sold in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income in the same period as the related costs are recognized.\\n             During 2015 and 2014, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted the fixed rate on a portion of our long-term\\n             borrowings to a variable short-term rate based on the LIBOR plus an interest markup. These swaps are designated as fair value hedges. Amounts recognized\\n             in Interest expense were immaterial for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.\\n             During the first quarter of 2016, the Company entered into and terminated two Euro interest rate swap agreements to hedge the anticipated issuance of\\n             fixed-rate debt. These swaps were designated as cash flow hedges. The effective portions of cash flow hedges are recorded in OCI as a component of\\n             Losses on derivatives qualifying as hedges in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. The Company incurred a loss of Euro 2.9\\n             million ($3.2 million) due to the termination of these swaps.

ZoomEssence is\\n                                                    seeking an injunction and monetary damages. ZoomEssence initially sought a temporary restraining\\n                                                    order and preliminary injunction, but the Court denied these applications in an order entered on\\n                                                    September 27, 2013, finding that ZoomEssence had not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the\\n                                                    merits of its claims. On November 3, 2014, ZoomEssence amended its complaint against the Company to\\n                                                    include allegations of breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, fraud in the inducement,\\n                                                    and misappropriation of confidential and proprietary information.

During the third quarter of 2016, the Court stayed the\\n                                                    case and directed the parties to engage in mediation. The mediation, which took place in October\\n                                                    2016, did not result in a resolution of the litigation; we cannot reliably predict the timing of a\\n                                                    trial, but it is expected that it would take place in 2017. Based on information available and\\n                                                    expert assessment of potential exposure, the Company recorded an additional reserve of $25 million\\n                                                    during the three months ended September 30, 2016.\\n                                                    The Company determines estimates of reasonably possible losses or ranges of reasonably possible\\n                                                    losses in excess of related accrued liabilities, if any, when it has determined that either a loss\\n                                                    is reasonably possible or a loss in excess of accrued amounts is reasonably possible and the amount\\n                                                    of losses or range of losses is determinable.

This\\n                                              guidance will be effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early\\n                                              adoption will be permitted for all entities. The Company does not expect this adoption will have a\\n                                              significant impact on its statement of cash flows.\\n                                              In March 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which requires changes to several aspects of the\\n                                              accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the treatment of income tax consequences,\\n                                              classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification of certain items on the\\n                                              statement of cash flows.

Among other changes, the standard\\n                                              requires that employee taxes paid when an employer withholds shares be presented in the Consolidated\\n                                              Statement of Cash Flows as a financing activity instead of an operating activity. The Company expects to\\n                                              adopt this change retroactively and that the impact of this aspect of the standard on the Consolidated\\n                                              Statement of Cash Flows will be approximately $20-$25 million on an annual basis.

The new guidance establishes a new lease accounting model, that requires entities to record assets\\n                                              and liabilities related to leases on the balance sheet for certain types of leases. The guidance will be\\n                                              effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 31, 2018.

The Company expects the adoption of this guidance will result in significant\\n                                              increases to assets and liabilities on its Consolidated Balance Sheet and is still evaluating the impact\\n                                              on its Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.\\n                                              In September 2015, the FASB issued authoritative guidance relating to the adjustments made during the\\n                                              measurement period for items in a business combination. Specifically, the new guidance requires\\n                                              adjustments related to the finalization of estimates to be recorded in the period when they are determined\\n                                              and to provide certain additional disclosures. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after\\n                                              December 15, 2015. The Company adopted this guidance during 2016 and the adoption did not have a\\n                                              significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.\\n                                              In April 2015, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which requires that debt issuance costs related to a\\n                                              recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount\\n                                              of that debt liability. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December\\n                                              15, 2015. The Company adopted this guidance retrospectively in 2016 and accordingly has reclassified all\\n                                              debt issuance costs on long-term debt as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability\\n                                              in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015. The adoption of this guidance did not have a\\n                                              significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.\\n                                              In May 2014, the FASB issued authoritative guidance to clarify the principles to be used to recognize\\n                                              revenue and made subsequent clarifications under the new requirements during May 2016. The guidance is\\n                                              applicable to all entities and is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15,\\n                                              2017. Adoption as of the original effective date is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the\\n                                              impact that this new standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.\\nAccounts Receivable                           Accounts Receivable\\n                                              The Company sells certain accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis to unrelated financial institutions\\n                                              under factoring\" agreements that are sponsored, solely and individually, by certain customers.
